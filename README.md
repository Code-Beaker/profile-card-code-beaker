## Built With 🛠️

- Visual Studio Code
- HTML
- CSS
- Vite

## What I learned 📚

I learned to make use of `position: absolute` in positioning the profile image and also for the divider. Used responsive `clamp()` values for typography and CSS custom properties to make my code better and easier to use.

Used `npm run build` to make a production build of my project that is minified for better performance by Vite.
